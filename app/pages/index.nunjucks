             <p>The China metals case study video shows us that successful innovators and entrepreneurs ‘think differently’.
             </p>
             <p>To think differently, a business needs to think about what it CAN Do, not just about what they currently do.  All businesses change over time - they acquire new assets, the business environment changes, customers’ needs change and competition increases.  But developing a business strategy based on being innovative is cheaper than a strategy based on being more competitive.
             </p>
             <p>Think about a business and ask yourself “Is what they do, the best use of their capabilities?” Often it is not, and China Metals shows how “Can Do” can be changed to “We do.”
             </p>
             <p>This ‘thinking differently’ approach is particularly important for family businesses where it might be time to think: “What should this business be doing with the skills and resources it has?” The business today may not necessarily be the business that will grow and continue to be successful. Imagine what this new business will look like.
