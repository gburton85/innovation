            <p>Communication is a very important innovation skill and talking about your idea, or how you will be innovative, is a great way of developing your ability to communicate your passion for innovation and entrepreneurship.  This is a skill valued by employers as well as potential entrepreneur business partners.
            </p>
            <p>Discuss your innovation ideas as this will help you test and improve them. Talking about your ideas can also help you find partners and people to work with. A big danger is falling in love with your idea, and not be able to see the areas that could be improved, so talking about your idea will help you refine your idea and potential business.
            </p>
            <p>Sketch a business model, share it with others and when you think you have finished, ask yourself “Where is the innovation? What are the assumptions hidden in the model that need testing? How can I test these assumptions in a low cost way?”
            </p>

            <p>For example a business that cares for older people might assume that older people are lonely! But are they really lonely? Are older people any more or less lonely than younger people?”
              Keep thinking, how can I try this in a low cost way? Create two business models:
              <ul>
                <li>A low cost test to see if customers want what we are offering</li>
                <li>How can we run this business for many more customers? How can we scale it up?</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Keep using your ‘think differently’ skills to help you be an innovator, no matter what you do.  Using this mind-set you can “build your own dreams, not someone else’s!”
            </p>
